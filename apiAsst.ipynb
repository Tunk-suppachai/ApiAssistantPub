      "Assistant Response: To build lean muscles, Mr. Bond, it is generally recommended to perform a moderate number of repetitions per set, typically falling between 8 to 12 reps. This rep range is commonly associated with promoting muscle hypertrophy, or the growth and definition of lean muscle mass.\n",
      "\n",
      "By selecting a weight that challenges you within this rep range, you create the necessary stimulus for muscle fibers to adapt and grow. It's important to use proper form and technique while lifting to ensure effective muscle recruitment.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that incorporating variations in your rep range can also be beneficial. Lower rep ranges, such as 4 to 6 reps, are often utilized for strength gains, whereas higher rep ranges, like 15 to 20 reps, can improve muscular endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, consistency is key in your training regimen. Gradually increase the weight you lift over time, a principle known as progressive overload, to continually challenge your muscles and stimulate growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pair your workout routine with a balanced diet and adequate rest to optimize your muscle-building efforts. Should you require further guidance or personalised advice, consider consulting with a qualified fitness professional who can design a program tailored to your specific needs and goals.\n",
