      "\n",
      "Performing 8 to 12 reps is often considered optimal for muscle hypertrophy, or the growth and development of lean muscle mass. By lifting weights within this range, you provide enough stimulus to your muscles to encourage adaptation and growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to note that the specific rep range can vary depending on individual factors such as fitness level, goals, and exercise selection. Some individuals may benefit from higher or lower rep ranges, depending on their specific needs and preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Incorporating variety into your training can also be beneficial. Lower rep ranges (such as 4 to 6 reps) tend to emphasize strength gains, while higher rep ranges (such as 12 to 15 or more) can focus on muscular endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to prioritize proper form and technique during your workouts to maximize the effectiveness of your exercises and reduce the risk of injury. In addition to rep ranges, other factors such as progressive overload, rest, recovery, and a balanced diet all play significant roles in building lean muscles.\n",
